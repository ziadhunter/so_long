# 🕹️ so_long

A simple 2D graphical game built in C using the MiniLibX library, as part of the 42 Network curriculum.

## 📌 Overview

In **so_long**, the player moves a character through a maze-like map to collect all the coins and reach the exit. The game validates maps, handles user input, and includes enemy behavior (bonus), all rendered using the minimalist MiniLibX graphics library.

This project covers fundamental concepts in game loops, map parsing, file handling, memory management, and basic graphics programming.
